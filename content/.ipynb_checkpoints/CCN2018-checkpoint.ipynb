    "[My conference paper](https://ccneuro.org/2018/Papers/ViewPapers.asp?PaperNum=1147) was selected for an oral presentation, which is embedded below. The topic of the presentation is part of my PhD thesis, and explores the role of context in categorization, perception, and decision making. We use a novel set of tools that I developed (now located at [github.com/timsainb/AVGN](https://github.com/timsainb/AVGN)), where latent representations (from variational autoencoders) of birdsong are linearly sampled from to produce smoothly varying stimuli for a category learning task. In this task, we were successfully able to bias categorical perception in songbirds based upon contextual information, and are currently in the process of studying the neural mechanisms underlying that contextual bias in perception.
