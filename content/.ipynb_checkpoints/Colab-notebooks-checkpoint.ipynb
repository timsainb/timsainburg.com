    "Jupyter notebooks are great for sharing code, but the step between showing people the code you produced, and allowing them to run that code can be difficult. Notebooks that you're running within your own environment usually relies on external code that makes it difficult to just copy a notebook and run it. In an ideal world, we want people to be able to run our notebooks as easily as look at them. \n",

    "Google Colab is a great bridge to allow you to quickly run someone else's notebooks, but Colab still requires that you have the right code dependencies available. Here is a quick fix that I have been using to run Colab Notebooks that require external dependencies easily. An example can be seen in my [Tensorflow 2 Generative Models repository](https://github.com/timsainb/tensorflow2-generative-models/)."

Since google.colab is a colab specific module, if it's available, you are in Colab. \n",
