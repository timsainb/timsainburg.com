    "I have previously created my Curriculum Vitae (CV) in both Word and LaTeX, and found that neither had the flexibility that I wanted. Ideally, I want to future-proof my CV so that it's easy to do things like change formatting without having to manually edit every entry into the CV. To do that, it seems intuitive that you would want a standardized data format to carry your CV <i>data</i> and a template to format that code into your CV design. The data format should look something like json or YAML:"

I ended up using the Colin Rafel method as the basis for my CV because I wanted to rely only on code that is either (1) self-contained within the repository or (2) very well supported external software. All this code relies upon is (1) Python and (2) [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/). "
